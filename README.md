Storing user motion patterns

This data can be used to better service the overall UX with customized app suggestions, advertising, and even accident detection. The motion data is collected through many of the mobile device's internal sensors, such as the acclerometer, barometer, ghyroscope, and GPS (if enabled by user, but not required)

SIZE OF TEAM:
2-4

BUSINESS
Every business today is focusing large funds and effort to reaching real potential customers. An example is AdSense and facebookAds using user data and cookies to display only user-relevent ads. In the modern-day age of Big Data, there is a an enormous demand for customizing UX to each user, and this technology could easily be sold to any of these companies seeking to do so.

TECHNICAL
The motion data is collected through many of the mobile device's internal sensors, such as the acclerometer, barometer, ghyroscope, and GPS (if enabled by user, but not required). GPS would allow the motion data to also be put into the context of a location (i.e. mountain biking vs. cycling). Database stores raw data for current and future analyzation, along with detected patterns and user information.

Name your project, and think of ways to make it sound appealing. State the size of team you'd like to work on it, and which of the four kinds of NoSQL database you're leaning towards using for the second implementation (after the relational one).

Include something about each of these aspects of your  proposed project: Business, Legal, and Technical.
